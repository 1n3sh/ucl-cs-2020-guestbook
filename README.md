# Welcome to CS @ UCL!

## [Skip to the Guestbook](./GUESTBOOK.md)

If you've reached this repository, well done - you've reached the end of my Intro to Git & GitHub talk!

Here are a few reminders from the talk:

- Git is a time machine (kind-of)
  - you can _go back in time_
  - you can _rewrite history_
  - you can _collaborate with others on code_
- projects are split into _repositories_
- you make a _commit_ to make a 'checkpoint' of your code
- GitHub is a website that lets you manage your Git repositories, and provides a pretty UI to do so (it also has a bunch of features to help make it easier to work with others on projects!)

**Your challenge:** use GitHub's interface, GitHub Desktop, or the Git CLI (terminal!) to edit the [**GUESTBOOK.md**](./GUESTBOOK.md) file and add your name (or username!) and a short fact(s) about yourself so we can get to know each other!

If you want to add a link to a personal website, or social media, or even a picture of yourself, feel free to do so too!

> Remember: **everything** in a public repository (like this!) can be **seen by the entire world** -- make sure you add a fact you are happy with anyone knowing and are happy with it being linked to your GitHub profile!

Here's an example of the [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)-formatted text you can add to the file:
